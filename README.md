A **Machine Learning** library written in pure Go designed to support relevant neural architectures in **Natural
Language Processing**.

spaGO is self-contained, in that it uses its own lightweight *computational graph* framework for both training and
inference, easy to understand from start to finish.

## Features

- Automatic differentiation:
    - Define-by-Run (default, just like PyTorch does)
    - Define-and-Run (similar to the static graph of TensorFlow)

- Optimization methods:
    - Gradient descent (Adam, RAdam, RMS-Prop, AdaGrad, SGD)
    - Differential Evolution

- Neural networks:
    - Feed-forward models (Linear, Highway, Convolution, ...)
    - Recurrent models (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM...)
    - Attention mechanisms (Self-Attention, Multi-Head Attention, ...)
    - Recursive auto-encoders

## Usage

Requirements:

* [Go 1.18](https://golang.org/dl/)

Clone this repo or get the library:

```console
go get -u github.com/nlpodyssey/spago
```

At a high level, it comprises four main modules:

1. Matrix
2. Graph
3. Model
4. Optimizer

To get started, look at the implementation of built-in neural models, such as
the [LSTM](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/blob/main/nn/recurrent/lstm/lstm.go). Don't be afraid, it is
straightforward Go code. The idea is that you could have written spaGO :)

## Known Limits

Sadly, at the moment, spaGO is not GPU friendly by design.

## Projects Using spaGO

Below is a list of known projects that use spaGO:

* [Golem](https://github.com/kirasystems/golem) - A batteries-included implementation
  of ["TabNet: Attentive Interpretable Tabular Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442).
* [WhatsNew](https://github.com/SpecializedGeneralist/whatsnew/) - A simple tool to collect and process quite a few web
  news from multiple sources.
* [Translator](https://github.com/SpecializedGeneralist/translator) - A simple self-hostable Machine Translation
  service.
* [GoTransformers](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/gotransformers) - State of the art Natural Language Processing in Go.

## Acknowledgments

spaGO is part of the open-source [NLP Odyssey](https://github.com/nlpodyssey) initiative
initiated by members of the EXOP team (now part of Crisis24). I would therefore like to thank [EXOP GmbH](https://www.exop-group.com/en/) here,
which is providing full support for development by promoting the project and giving it increasing importance.

## Sponsors

We appreciate contributions of all kinds. We especially want to thank spaGO fiscal sponsors who contribute to ongoing
project maintenance.

See our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nlpodyssey/contribute) page if you too are interested in becoming a sponsor.
